            <div style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:0px;" class="child">The price of crypto in the current range is seen going up near October of 2020. The price of crypto correlates to the amount of crypto mining taking place.<br>Crypto mining is the facilitating of transactions done with a cryptocurrency. To do this en masse, a miner needs a lot of GPU working around the clock.<br>With a massive increase in price, it is safe to say that the demand for GPUs also increased dramatically. Because of this crypto gold rush, Nvidia took action and began producing GPUs that have a significantly weakened ability to cryptomine, in order to stabilize the supply of GPUs.</div>
