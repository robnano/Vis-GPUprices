At the same time people were stuck at home during<br>the lockdowns, many of whom had to work from home. We can assume that the demand<br>for technology went up since most people had to adjust to working from home and staying home all the time.<br>Though production went up, the prices still kept going up, and based on the principles<br>of supply and demand we can assume that the increase in production from the middle of May did not keep up with the demand.</div>
